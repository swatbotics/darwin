The lib_control_robot directory builds into a library that contains

Robot control through the body class, which gives access to a generic motion
module, that allows access to joint control. This requires the Linux darwin 
library

Joystick class that allows the user to read from Joystick.
The use of this class require the SDL library

Headers for math classes, including matrices, vectors, and transforms

Inverse Kinematic files generated by openrave

Forward Kinematics, along with forward kinematics information 

The kinematics class, including the forward, inverse, and differential 
kinematics. This requires opencv for matrix calculation

***********************************************************************

To see usage of these classes:

The control_ee program allows motion of the body controlled by joystick
 -uses the joystick library and the body class

one_foot moves the body and stands on one foot
 -uses the inverse and forward kinematics

one_foot_diff at this point moves the body, rotation and translation, 
to shift center of mass. 
 -uses differential kinematics
