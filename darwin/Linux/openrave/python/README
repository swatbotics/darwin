The python folder contains the python scripts for using openrave

The Darwin robot xml file needed to use openrave on is located in the xml
folder in this directory.

IK_test.py
This demonstrates how to load a robot, generating/loading a ik module,
and using IK in openrave. The manipulator indices are:
0 - left arm
1 - right arm
2 - left leg
3 - right leg

IK_fast_generation.py
This generates the stand-alone IK cpp file. The manipulator indices are
the same as above

ForwardKinematicsDataGeneration.py
This creates two files DarwinDynamicDefinition.h and .cpp. These files can be 
used to build into an object that contains the dynamic information about the 
Darwin, including 
link info: 
the name of the links
the center of mass of each of the links
the axis about which each link rotate
the transform between the previous joint and the next joint of the link.

chain (limb) info:
the starting link of each chain
the starting transform of each chain
